## About

The HotMaps Dispatch Model is a web user interface to develop energy system models.
It is based on [Pyomo](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for modeling and [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/0.12.0/index.html) for visualization and interaction. 
The primary focus is flexible model creation with/and without the web user interface, and a high temporal resolution (hourly based) for the optimization. It has also the ability to execute and create many scenarios.  

A model can be fully defined by the web user interaface, with financal and technical details on technologies, demand,electricity,temperature and radiation profiles. You can also define and upload your own data. The Hotmaps Disptach Model takes these inputs and constructs an optimization problem, solves it, and reports back the results. The results are saved as HTML (for visualisation), JSON and EXCEL Files and can be further analyzed.

## How to install

> ### **Before you continue, please install the [GUROBI Solver](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer-eula/) or the free [GLPK Solver](http://winglpk.sourceforge.net/)**



### How to install 
1. install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

2. Download this [repository](https://github.com/tuw-eeg/hotmapsDispatch/archive/master.zip) and save and unzip the content into your desired loacation

2. open the conda prompt in that location and type following comands 

    a. `conda env create -f environment.yml` 
    
    b. `conda activate hotmapsDispatch`
    
    c. `python -m app ` for the GUROBI solver  or if you want to use the GLPK solver `python -m app --s glpk` 

After that your default browser should open and the web user interface will show up


### Quick Start
To Start the tool after installation open the conda prompt and type following commands:
1. activate your environment with `conda activate hotmapsDispatch`
2. navigate to the location you unzip the tool by typing `cd path2folder` (Note: Replace "path2folder" with the path of the location where you unzip the tool)
3. type `python -m app ` for the GUROBI solver  or if you want to use the GLPK solver `python -m app --s glpk`
After that your default browser should open and the web user interface will show up
