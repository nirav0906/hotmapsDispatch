Investment Mode
============================

The application is implemented as a linear program and can be used on the one hand as a pure dispatch model and on the other hand for **investment planning** (how much capacities to install) to *cover a load profile with the minimum costs*.

```{note}
- If you enable this toggle button, it is important to specify the heat producers
and heat storages by **marking them** (hold CTRL and left mouse click to select the
desired generators and storages) for which an investment model should run.

- If you are in scenario mode, all technologies and storage that are defined are used for capacity extension.

- If predefined capacities are available, this is the minimum value. This means that no installed capacities can be reduced, only an expansion is possible.
