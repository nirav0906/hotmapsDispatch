This *Get Started* guide aims to get you using the
Hotmaps-Dispatch-Application as quickly as possible.

## Workflow

1.  Visit the Website [Dispatch Invert] (http://dispatch.invert.at) and
    log in with your user data
2.  The Web User Interface loads
3.  Select a heat demand profile in the *Heat Demand* tab or
    upload your own profile via  *Load Individual Data*
    tab, see {doc}`The Web User Interface`.
4.  Set the yearly heat consumption of your region in the *Heat Demand* tab or in the *Parameters* tab, by  editing the *Total Demand [MWh]* input widget.
5.  Add predefined *heat generators* or *heat storages* in the*Heat Producers and Heat Storage* tab by pressing the   **`+`**   button or upload custom generators via the *Upload Power Plant Parameters* button
6.  Set various prices, parameters, profiles, etc. or upload your own data and
    click on the *Run Dispatch Model* button
7.  After 60 to 120 seconds the results are shown in the output section, for details see {doc}`Outputs`


## Things to consider 

```{warning}
   Refreshing the page of the program deletes all the progress !
```

```{tip}
   + Always save your progress by downloading the created structure after calculation
   + After calculation is done download the result files
   + Copy the link of the results. If something occurs, you can access your results within two hours which saves time.
   + If you upload your own data, pay attention to the needed structure as described in {doc}`The Web User Interface`, especially the subchapter *Button section*.
-   Look up the heat generator types that are available when generating your custom structure outside the application
-   Don’t forget to press the `✓` - button in the Sale-/Electricity Price tab, because only so changes take effect (for details see {doc}`The Web User Interface`, *Notification section*).
   + If the page does not respond for a long time or something else happened, refresh the page and try again, if the issue is still present, then look up the following chapters for more detailed description. If you still have the issue, please document all settings you made (browser type, parameters, data etc.)
